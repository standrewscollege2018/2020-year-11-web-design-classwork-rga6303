    <p>I was lucky enough to visit Europe last year and wanted to share some of my experiences and photos
</p>
<p>Some of the countries I visited were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>United Kingdom</li>
  <li>Italy</li>
  <li>Greece</li>
  <li>France</li>
</ul>
<p>Discover more about what we saw in each country below!</p>
<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
<p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!
</p>
<p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.

  <h2>Greece</h2>
  <p>Greece was our first major trip away, and after a cold half-term in England we were happy to get to the much milder climate of Greece!

  We stayed on Crete for a week, and then spent a few days exploring Athens.

  Some of our highlights are below:</p>
